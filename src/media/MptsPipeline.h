// M2tsPacketizer per program reads its queue on a worker thread of its own,
// and the workers push their Objects into one small merged queue, from which
// the publisher takes them in order. A stalled program does not fill the
// merged queue, so it holds up no other, and the publisher (ObjectLookahead)
// holds back no more than its one latest Object per track. While the
// publisher does not pull (no subscriber yet), the program queues take the
// wait and drop their oldest packets. At the first pull, nothing read before
// it goes out but the catalog: every program starts at its next random access
// point after the pull, at the live edge. A program that ends, or whose
// packetizer fails to read (error() says why), ends its own track only: its
// last Object closes its Group, and the other programs go on.
