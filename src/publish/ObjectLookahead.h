// Decides final_in_subgroup for a stream of Objects that interleaves several

// track starts another Group, so each track holds back its latest Object until
// its next one arrives. Holding one Object per track, rather than everything
// behind the oldest held Object, means a track that stalls or ends holds back
// its own last Object only, and every other track keeps flowing. MOQT orders
// nothing across tracks, so the cross-track order may change; the Objects of
// one track keep their order.
//
// An Object with finalInGroup set (a catalog or timeline Object) goes out at
// once, unless it describes a track that holds an Object (afterTrack): a
// timeline Object then goes out right after the media Object it records,
// which MSF -01 Section 7 requires to be published first. An endsTrack marker
// releases its track's held Object as final and is not sent. At the end of the
// source, the held Objects go out as final, in the order they arrived. An
// Object that ends the broadcast (endsBroadcast) is the source's last: the
// held Objects go out first, so it follows every Object it closes.
